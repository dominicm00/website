# Dominic's Website
Welcome to my personal site! This is a work in progress so there isn't much here for the moment.

## Structure
All the content (excluding this README so sourcehut can render it) is written in [Skribe](https://www-sop.inria.fr/members/Manuel.Serrano/publi/jfp05/article.html) and rendered with [Haunt](https://dthompson.us/projects/haunt.html).
