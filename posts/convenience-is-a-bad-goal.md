Everyone likes convenience. In fact, we like it so much that many of our day to
day decisions are primarily influenced by it. However, just because something is
convenient, doesn't mean it's good—or even enjoyable!

Convenience can be a useful tool, in that if we make _good_ things convenient
(e.g. public transport) we can encourage people to use them. However, modern
society often enables unhealthy forms of convenience.

## Abstracting cost

Convenience, and particularly technological convenience, is used to hide real
costs. When you order delivery you no longer interact with the restaurant or
delivery driver. When you buy on Amazon you no longer interact with a store and
cashier. Business externalities are purposely hidden from you so that they don't
factor into your mental calculus. Abstracting away the costs involved in
business and reducing everything to a monetary exchange robs individuals of
agency and importance.

## Consumerism

The advent of an economy where people simply continue buying more and more new
things is relatively recent. We used to be able to fix products, or continue to
reuse them for a long time. However, given a design trade-off between
convenience and sustainability we almost universally choose convenience.

Think of how much waste is involved in every purchase you make. Every wrapper
from the grocery store, box from buying online, etc. Convenience has both
increased the waste of individual purchases, and increased the amount that we
buy.

## Discomfort is important

Convenience is a result of our avoidant tendencies. We use convenience to avoid
discomfort, but many discomforts are normal, and healthy, to experience.

If you are forced to confront the reality of where your food and products come
from, to interact with someone, or to see what other people are going through,
_that is a good thing_. Avoiding discomfort is not worth also avoiding truth.
