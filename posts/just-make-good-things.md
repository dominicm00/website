Software companies are obsessed with measuring their products. They measure
every single click, hover, and engagement. They run controlled studies to
determine if a new feature is significantly (in the statistical sense) better.
Immense effort is put in to ensure that every single aspect of a product is
measured and known.

We need to stop.

## Wait, what? Why?
- Measurements are short term, focused on incremental changes
- When the metric becomes the goal, it begins to deviate from a positive user
  experience
- User trust degrades easily, and a loss of trust doesn't show up in an A/B test
- People are so starved for quality products, that if you actually put in the
  work to make something good they will use it
- Enshrining measurements stops your workers from really thinking about what
  they're doing
- Companies that follow this path inevitably end up in enshittification, and
  then die once the next new not-horrible thing comes around
